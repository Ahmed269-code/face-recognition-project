# Project Description
This project focuses on **facial recognition and analysis** using deep learning and machine learning techniques. It involves face detection with **MTCNN**, feature extraction, and classification using models such as **SVM**.

Additionally, **PCA** is applied for dimensionality reduction, ensuring efficient processing. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to maintain data quality. The final model is optimized for accuracy and real-time performance to enhance reliability.
